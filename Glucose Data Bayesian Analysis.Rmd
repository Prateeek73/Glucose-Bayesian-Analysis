#### Skewness

-   The empirical distribution of glucose levels is rightly-skewed.
-   It means the data is more clustered towards lower end with a long tail extending towards right side

#### Kurtosis

-   The empirical distribution exhibits a leptokurtic shape.
-   Leptokurtic indicated sharper peaks and flatter tails of distribution.
-   This suggests a higher concentration of values around the mean and extremes(right tail in out distribution)

##### Outliers

-   There are several outlier values at the higher end of the glucose scale. These contribute to right skewdness and thus increasing the variability

### Split the samples to two parts. The first 2,500 samples are used as the first part and the last 2,500 samples are used as the second part. For each part and 𝜃(1),

##### (a) plot the histogram and kernel density;

##### (b) find the posterior mean and the posterior quantile based 95% confidence interval;

##### (c) plot the trace

##### (d) find the autocorrelation and the effective sample size.

```{R}
results <- gibbs_sampler(y = glucose, X = ifelse(glucose < median(glucose), 1, 2),
                          alpha = alpha, beta = beta,

### Conclusions

-   The histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) for the first 2500 and last 2500 samples remain nearly identical, indicating that the posterior distribution is stable and consistent across chains.
-   The close values of means and CIs for sample splits are almost same further confirming this
-   The values oscillate around the mean with a consistent variance and are not stuck in a region.
-   The values are not getting stuck in particular region, indicating good mixing,
-   Both ACF and ESS values for the last split is slightly lower than first split but still almost same.

## MCMC Diagnostic (Second peak)

### (2) 2 different chains (based on probability):

### Use the samples from the following initial value of 𝑋𝑖 - assign 𝑋𝑖(0) as 1 with the probability 0.5 and 2 otherwise. Again, the initial value of 𝜎12 is the sample variance of those 𝑦𝑖 with 𝑋𝑖 = 1 and the initial value of 𝜎12 is the sample variance of those y𝑖 with 𝑋𝑖 = 2. For each chain and 𝜃(2)

#### (a) plot the histogram and kernel density

#### (b) find the posterior mean and the posterior quantile-based 95% confidence interval

#### (c) plot the trace

#### (d) find the autocorrelation and the effective sample size.

#### Conclusions

-   The histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) for different chains remain nearly identical, indicating that the posterior distribution is stable and consistent across chains.
-   The close values of means and CIs for sample splits are almost same further confirming this
-   The values oscillate around the mean with a consistent variance and are not stuck in a region.
-   The values are not getting stuck in particular region, indicating good mixing,
-   Both ACF and ESS values for both independent chain are almost same too
-   Grouping Xi randomly with equal 0.5 probability has little to no impact on final results.

**The Gibbs sampler has converged successfully for both split samples and multiple chains. The MCMC diagnostic show us that the posterior distribution is reliable across the sampling process. The consistent posterior means and similar confidence intervals confirms that the results are consistent for both 𝜃(1) in case of diagnoses with splits and 𝜃(2) diagnoses with multiple chains**

##### Histogram and KDE:

-   The histograms and KDEs for both halves of the samples are similar, showing a stable and consistent posterior distribution for θ, which is approximately normal and centered around the posterior mean.

##### Posterior Mean and Confidence Interval (CI)

-   First 2500 samples: Mean = 103.96, 95% CI = [100.41, 107.68].
-   Last 2500 samples: Mean = 103.93, 95% CI = [100.37, 108.00].
-   The close values in means and CIs indicate that the Gibbs sampler has converged.
-   The mean value of sample is 120 whereas expected value is 103. The reason we have takes min values from min from 𝜃1 𝜃2 samples

##### Trace Plots

-   No visible trend or pattern, suggesting the chains have reached a stationary distribution. The values oscillate around the mean with a consistent variance
-   The chains have reached a stationary distribution with good mixing, suggesting convergence

##### Autocorrelation and Effective Sample Size

-   First 2500 samples: Autocorrelation = 0.1628 , Effective Sample Size = 134.
-   Last 2500 samples: Autocorrelation = 0.1419, Effective Sample Size = 94.
-   The slight increase in autocorrelation and decrease in effective sample size towards the end indicates less precision in the later samples, but the sampler still efficiently explores the parameter space.

**The Gibbs sampler has converged successfully, and the posterior distribution is stable across the sampling process. There is a slight increase in autocorrelation in the later samples where the effective sample size does decrease. However, the consistent posterior means and tight confidence intervals reinforce that the results are reliable.**

## MCMC Diagnostic (Second Peak)

### (3) Multiple chains (Chain split based on probability): Sampliing chain split in two

### Use the samples from the following initial value of 𝑋𝑖 - assign 𝑋𝑖(0) as 1 with the probability 0.5 and 2 otherwise. Again, the initial value of 𝜎12 is the sample variance of those 𝑦𝑖 with 𝑋𝑖 = 1 and the initial value of 𝜎12 is the sample variance of those y𝑖 with 𝑋𝑖 = 2. For each chain and 𝜃(2), (a) plot the histogram and kernel density; (b) find the posterior mean and the posterior quantile-based 95% confidence interval; (c) plot the trace; (d) find the autocorrelation and the effective sample size. State your conclusions.

#### Conclusions

##### Histogram and KDE:

-   The histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) for the first and last 2500 samples remain nearly identical, indicating that the posterior distribution is stable and consistent across chains.
-   The distribution is approximately normal, centered around the posterior means, and remains consistent between the initial and final samples, confirming convergence.

##### Posterior Mean and Confidence Interval (CI):

-   First 2500 samples: Mean = 149.88, 95% CI = [137.60, 161.99].
-   Last 2500 samples: Mean = 148.11, 95% CI = [136.35, 161.05].
-   The close values in means and CIs indicate that the Gibbs sampler has converged across multiple chains too which is greater than 120 and justfied we taking max of 𝜃1 𝜃2 values for this diagnostic

##### Trace Plots:

-   The trace plots for both the first and last 2500 samples show no visible trend or pattern, indicating the chains have reached a stationary distribution.
-   The values oscillate around the mean with consistent variance, suggesting good mixing and convergence.

##### Autocorrelation and Effective Sample Size:

-   First 2500 samples: Autocorrelation = 0.2794, Effective Sample Size = 59.
-   Last 2500 samples: Autocorrelation = 0.2901, Effective Sample Size = 52.
-   The slight increase in autocorrelation and decrease in effective sample size in the later samples indicate marginally lower precision, but the sampler effectively explores the parameter space.
-   The effective sample size remaining above 50 suggests sufficient information has been gathered from the posterior distribution.

##### Impact of Xi

-   The random initialization of 𝑋𝑖(with 50% probability of starting at 1 or 2) helped improve variability across chains, reducing the likelihood of the sampler getting stuck in local modes.
-   However, the higher autocorrelation and lower effective sample size suggest that the initial variability may not have fully removed some dependence between consecutive samples.

##### Differences

-   The mean of this chains is 137 which is higher than previous mean of 103, suggesting two peaks in our data
-   The ESS values for these chains 59, 52 which is quite less than our previous chain of 134 and 94, suggesting the our data is lot more distributed around first peak as compared to second peak

#### Combined conclusion

-   So, the two-component mixture model fits the glucose data reasonably well, capturing key features of the distribution.
-   The two-component mixture model should adequately capture the data distribution.
-   The Gibbs sampler converges effectively, though with some limitations in ESS and autocorrelation.

## MCMC Diagnostic (JAGS sampling): For each iteration of the Gibbs sampler, sample a value 𝑋\~2 −𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑖(𝜋(𝑠)) and then sample 𝑌̃ (𝑠)\~𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙(𝜃𝑥(𝑠), 𝜎𝑥(𝑠)) . Plot a histogram or kernel density estimate for the empirical distribution of {𝑌̃ (1), ⋯ , 𝑌̃ (𝑆)}, and compare it to the distribution from the data. Discuss the adequacy of this two-component mixture model for the glucose.

```{R}
# Preparing data and initial values
data_jags <- list(y = glucose, n = length(glucose),
  alpha = alpha, beta = beta, mu0 = mu0, s20 = s20, v0 = v0)
inits <- function(X_init) {
  list(X = X_init,s21 = var(glucose[X_init = 1]), s22 = var(glucose[X_init = 2]))

1.  The KDE of glucose data is skewed with peak shifted towards lower glucose values, with a tail towards higher glucose values and slight second peak towards those higher glucose values

2.  The KDE of sampled Y values from Gibbs sampler follows a similar pattern with slight minor differences.

Both histograms and KDE have a similar shape and distribution. So the two-component model is reasonably good to capture overall shape and spread of our glucose data distribution. Slight differences in distribution's peak and tail can be tuned by a more complex model like hierarchical model .
